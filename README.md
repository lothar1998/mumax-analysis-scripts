#### Description
This repository is created in purpose of scientific work in Spintronic Devices Simulation team at [**AGH University of Science and Technology**](https://www.agh.edu.pl/). It is created to collect and analyse data from spintronic simulations. 

#### SpinWaves
It's a script to visualize spin waves. It's based on **OVF 2.0 files**.
To get more help, use: ```python3 SpinWaves.py --help``` .

#### PLGrid
There is a script to create variations of **mx3** file. It edits one parameter. Script allows creating a sbatch file to run simulation on **PLGrid**.
To get more help, use: ```python3 CreateVar.py --help``` .
To run many shell files (.sh) use: ```run.sh <directory>``` .
